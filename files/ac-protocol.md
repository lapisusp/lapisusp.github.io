**Objective:** Identify the state of art of adapting applications using Affective Computing (AC).

**Research questions:**

A) What techniques have been used to recognize the user’s emotional state?
B) Knowing the emotional state of the user, what are the possibilities of adapting the computational application?

**Population:**

Projects that work with the adaptation of applications based on the affective state of the user.

**Intervention:**

Emotion recognition techniques and adapted elements.

**Expected Results:**

Comprehensive and in-depth view on affective computing techniques for adapting applications from the user’s emotional state.

**Applications:**

Computational applications, specially directed to the health area, that carried out affective adaptation.

**Keywords:**

affective adaptation, affective game, affective computing.

**Method of search:**

Based on the keywords, search strings will be constructed and submitted in the main databases. The articles found will be listed, their titles and summaries will be read to verify compliance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. If it meets the requirements of the protocol, it will be selected.

**Source selection criteria:**

The sources should be available via the web, preferably in scientific databases of the area. Work available in other media may also be selected provided they meet the requirements of the Systematic Review.

**Databases:**

Searches will take place in the following databases: IEEE digital library, ACM, Scopus and PubMed.

**Criteria for inclusion (I) of primary studies:**
I1) works that deal with the affective adaptation of applications or games, explaining from the recognition of emotions to the adaptations made;
I2) papers published and available in full in scientific databases.

**Criteria for exclusion (E) of primary studies:**
E1) works that do not use AC techniques;
E2) works that do not use such techniques for adapting applications / games.

**Quality criteria:**

Only works that aim to adapt computational applications through the use of Affective Computing will be considered. Research with very different focuses will be excluded.
