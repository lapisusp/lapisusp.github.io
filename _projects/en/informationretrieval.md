Technology has been acted as a transformative agent of our society, changing our ways of working and the manner that we relate. One of the effects of this modernization is the data generation by electronic devices and systems. Since 2005, data has grown exponentially every two years, with a total volume of 44,000 EB of data estimated for the year 2020. Given this backgroud, the delopment of intelligent methods to process and retrieve this data  is relevant and necessary. Most of LApIS projects aim to retrieval medical data related mainly to 2D and 3D images.
