The tool that changes the facial expression in photographs behind the game described in previous page is one of the objectives of this research. The change in the facial expression of the photo is based on modifying the photo by an example. That is, there is a set of examples (facial expressions database) and the tool chooses the one that most resembles the face provided by the user (player). Then, the changes concerning the facial expression in the chosen image are identified. These identified changes are used for modifying the provided image. Finally, such modifications of the expression are merged into the face provided so as to generate the new image containing the desired facial expression, as exemplified in the figure below.

**Abstract:**

The ability to process and identify facial emotions are essential factors for an individual's social interaction. Some psychiatric disorders can limit an individual's ability to recognize emotions in facial expressions. This problem could be confronted by using computational techniques in order to develop learning environments for diagnosis, evaluation, and training in identifying facial emotions.  With this motivation,  the objective of this work is to define, implement and evaluate a method to synthesize realistic facial expression that represents emotions in images of real people. The main idea of the studies found in the literature is that a facial expression of one person’s image can be reenacted in an another person’s image. The study differs from the approaches presented in the literature when proposing a technique that considers the similarity between facial images to choose the one that will be used as the origin for reenactment. As a result, we intend to increase the realism of the synthesized images. Our approach to solve the problem, besides searching for the most similar facial components in the image dataset, also deforms the facial elements and maps the differences of illumination in the target image. A visual analysis showed that the images synthesized on the basis of similar faces presented an adequate degree of realism, especially when compared with images synthesized from random faces. The study will contribute to the generation of the images applied to tools for the diagnosis and therapy of psychiatric disorders, and also contribute to the computational field, through the proposition of new techniques for facial expression synthesis.
